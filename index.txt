✅ NGINX Reverse Proxy Status

- The web server at http://localhost is now running through NGINX.
- This is the same as accessing http://localhost:80 because port 80 is the default HTTP port.
- NGINX is configured to listen on port 80 and act as a reverse proxy.
- Requests to http://localhost are forwarded to the backend Express.js server running on port 3000.
- Apache2 has been disabled to avoid conflicts with NGINX.
- Everything is working as expected!

Accessing: http://localhost → (NGINX port 80) → http://localhost:3000 (Express.js)
